### Introduction to MongoDB ============>

- ### What is MongoDB?

1- MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database management system, which internally stores data in the form of BSON, but we as normal developers can send or receive data in the form of JSON, internally MongoDB manages the conversion of JSON-BSON and BSON-JSON automatically.

2- Designed for flexibility, scalability, and performance in handling unstructured or semi-structured data.


### What is a Document Database?
A document database (also known as a document-oriented database or a document store) is a database that stores information in documents.

- ### SQL vs NoSQL


|                               **SQL**                                              |                                  **NoSQL**                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1- SQL databases are relational databases.                                          |1- NoSQL databases are non-relational databases. |
|2- They use structured tables to store data in rows and columns.                    |2- They provide flexibility in data storage, allowing varied data types and structures.|
|3- Suitable for applications with well-defined schemas and fixed data structures.   |3- Ideal for applications with dynamic or evolving data models. |
|4- E-commerce Platform, HR Management, etc.                                         |4- CMS, Social Media Platforms, Gaming, etc.|
|5- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.                                             |5- Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis. |
